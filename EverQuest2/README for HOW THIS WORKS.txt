In order to make everything easier to understand, this directory is designed to be 
copied to your main innerspace installation directory.   

So, once you've updated all your files via svn, all you will need to do is highlight 
all of the folders in this directory and copy it to your main innerspace directory.


Finally, if you have any questions on the syntax or usage of these scripts, please
