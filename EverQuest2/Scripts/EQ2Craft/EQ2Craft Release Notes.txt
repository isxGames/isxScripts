Revision History ||
===================
v9.5  - The script will now allow up to 25 writs to be queued (regardless of location.)

v9.14 - Added code to make primalz quit bitching about writs being overwritten
        on exit. New cmdline option -sort to enable sorting and saving of writ
        file.

v9.13 - Added ${ICraft.TotalQueued} method. Returns total number of combines
        queued. (may be broken currently)

v9.11 - Updated for GU58 writ npc madness. Will now apply_verb Hail with writ 
        giver instead of :DoubleClick

v9.1  - French Localization
        * Should work properly in guildhalls; however, writs in TS Instances 
          may not function perfectly due to lack of data
        * Wholesaler names (not guild tags) should be added to the appropriate
          section of /eq2craft/Recipe Data/Common.xml
        
v9.00 - Integration of Recipe Search function, thanks to Noob536.

v8.99 - Infestation by CyberTechs!
        * Added support for navigating to retrieve writ invoices
          NavPoints: Invoices and Invoices 1 thru Invoices 5
          Bot will select the closest NavPoint to your writ npc
        ** If the clipboard is not within clicking range of your writ npc, you
           MUST define the Invoices region(s)
        * -debug mode will now display at startup, a list of all possible
          NavPoint names used by the script, whether they were found, and
          whether there is a path to the NavPoint.
        * Improved reporting of missing required NavPoints
        * Log message to console when an error causes craft to go into resume
          mode, in addition to UI
      - Updated writ parser to allow for "I must create" recipes.
      - Now with MOAR STFU! - Craft will now only complain about missing
        resources.xml entries ONCE per item per session.
      - Fixed drooling issues when running without nav path.
      - Craft will no longer set or reset Guild Event Privacy settings if
        neither option is enabled.

v8.98 - Changed hardcoded lvl 80 code to lvl 90 for SF expansion.

v8.97 - Minor changes to config file structure. Movement keys now save to
        global config file.

v8.96 - Adjusted commandline arguments relating to verbosity. Default
        verbosity is now for error messages only, displayed in the console
        window.
        * Changed -verbose option to -chat option (see below)
        * Added -v, -vv, -q, -chat options:
          -v     Verbose mode. Will echo to console/chat window. This used to
                 be the default.
          -vv    Extra verbose mode. Implies -debug. Echos everything possible
          -q     Quiet mode. Not even error messages will display.
          -chat  Sends all non-debug output to the EQ2 chat window. This
                 replaces the old option for -verbose.
      - Added support for the new Achievement Award craft tables in guild
        halls. Craft will favor Elaborate tables in guild halls, but will
        attempt to use normal (no prefix) tables if unable to target an
        Elaborate table.
      - Ignore while crafting (invites, etc) will no longer be in effect while
        in CraftLite mode.

v8.94 - Added TTS announcements between writs, and after writ sessions are complete.
      - Added congratulatory TTS announcements when gaining levels and auto-scribing new recipes.
      - Updated Writ tab of UI to use a Slider for writ count.
      - Maximum number of writs allowed in guild halls increased to 10. Non-guildhall writs still
        limited to 5.

v8.93 - Fixed Writ Reward Window bug. No more "Automatically accepted OMGHAX Quest Rewards." when
        logging in or zoning! (Thanks HotShot)
      - Really really fixed the Reset Thresholds button to actually set thresholds to the current
        defaults.

v8.92 - Bugfix release. Slightly increased delay between turning in and getting new writ. This
        will hopefully resolve some issues with craft randomly being unable to obtain a new writ
        quest.

v8.91 - Bugfix release. Craft -load really works now.

v8.9  - REALLY fixed spell writs to work with GU52 changes. Jewelers and Alchemists rejoice!

v8.8  - Fixed spell writs to work with GU52 changes.

v8.7  - Tweaked commandline switches slightly. <Recipe Queue> in the second syntax is no longer
        required to be alone. This means you can use -debug and still include a recipe queue to
        get the original behavior.
      - Moved recipe favorite lists out of the Character Config xml file. All recipe favorite
        lists are self-contained in their own simple xml settings files, within the (NEW) Queues
        subfolder.
      - Craft will auto-populate the favorites list with the recipe queues from your class. You
        may select a different class, or the "ALL" selection to view other recipe favorites in
        your Queues folder.
      - When saving a recipe queue, craft will automatically prefix the filename with your
        tradeskill subclass.
      - Text to Speech support is now available. This will require the LSMTTS Lavishscript Module
        (available on the SVN) to function correctly. This option will default to OFF, and is
        currently set up to only announce when you encounter a rare reaction (Innovation) or when
        your craft session is complete.


v8.65 - Added -load and -start commandline switches. Craft now has the following usage:
        Craft [-debug] [-verbose] [-load <Recipe Queue>] [-start]
        Craft [<Recipe Queue>]

        -debug                 Enables debug output to console and file
        -verbose               Shows some text in EQ2 chat window instead of console
        -load <Recipe Queue>   Loads and processes the specified saved favorite list, but does
                               not begin crafting. Allows you to go shopping before starting the
                               queue.
        -start                 If a recipe queue has been loaded with -load, this will begin
                               crafting after processing the recipe queue.

        <Recipe Queue>         Must be the only argument in this syntax. Loads queue, processes,
                               and begins crafting.

v8.64 - Minor change to help eliminate the "out of range" issues.

v8.63 - Added support for new UI element to display writs remaining in Crafting frame
      - Updated Craft UI to have a smaller footprint. Nuprecon provided much of this rearrangement
        of UI code. Thanks Nuprecon!

v8.62 - Stopped the crazy exiting bot when out of money. Craft will now wait the same as when
        buying harvests from the broker and unable to buy enough. (Resume Crafting button)

v8.61 - Fixed numerous bugs with the component quantity counting. This was a major rewrite of a
        large block of code. Please report any further bugs with quantity counting on the ISXEQ2
        bug tracker.
      - Updated to use the EQ2Common folder for included utilities.

v8.6  - Changed all "terminal" fonts in the GUI to default skinned font. Adjusted all text using
        that font to fit with the UI elements.
      - Removed initial blank lines from listboxes. This was annoying some people, and is not
        needed with the default font anyway.
      - Tweaked UI update code. Resources, Vendor bought components, Fuel, and Crafted components
        listboxes will no longer rebuild unless the number of items in the listbox changes. They
        will continue to update quantites on the fly. -- Please report any issues with the Queue
        (loading, saving, submitting, etc) on the forums.

v8.59 - Precision path writers rejoice! Craft will no longer try to stand on top of writ givers,
        wholesalers, or brokers. It will now stop within 3 meters of the point set in the
        navigation, and NOT try to adjust after that. Extra tight precision is still in effect
        for tradeskill devices.

v8.58 - Fixed error with saving recipe favorite lists.
      - Hopefully fixed guild hall targetting of non-Elaborate tables.

v8.57 - Fixed error in recipe processing
        More tweaks to CraftLite code

v8.56 - More scholar writ tweaks

v8.55 - Fixed <T8 scholar writ processing.

v8.54 - Fixed T8 scholar writ processing.
      - Fixed Provisioner writ processing. Note that all previously entered CustomWrits for
        provisioner will need to be fixed as they come up. Our parsed text is different than
        it used to be.

v8.53 - Changed writ recipe detection code. This should allow for a much smaller CustomWrits
        file.
      - Fixed guild privacy not getting re-set after completing one writ and starting the next.
      - Made the harvest frame stay on top where it's supposed to be. This was actually an
        unexpected side-effect of putting a texture on the tabs.
      - Slightly increased font size, and removed blank line from listboxes in the harvest frame.
      - Added more inventory checks and UI updates -- This should fix the issue of resources showing
        quantities from one step behind.

v8.52 - Fixed progressively long delays when processing recipes. Craft will now process the
        inventory only after processing the queue and failed recipes.

v8.51 - Craft will now move you to within 3m of tradeskill desks in a guildhall
      - New option added: "disable guild notifications entirely (while crafting)"

v8.5  - Buying from the broker should be even faster now
      - Lots of little bugs fixed
      - Added UI option to "disable guild events while doing writs" (it will properly restore
        your setting after finishing with writs and will ONLY disable during writs, not regular
        recipes.)

v8.43 - Added basic Guild Hall crafting functionality - Rush Order and Work Order NPCs,
        Work Order Clipboard, and Guild Fuel Merchant recognition.
      - Added code that will cause the script to utilize the harvest depot while in a guild hall
        as well as other optimizations dealing with available resources when the script first starts
      - Buying from the broker should be faster now

v8.42 - Added code to account for "Pristine Tailored XXX" recipes in writ recipe names.
      - Removed writ desk facing code. Looked way too botty.
      - Tweaks to movement code should make pathing better.
      - Re-tuned CraftLite code. It should now pick up on the first crafting tick as advertised.

v8.41 - Changed writ recipe name code slightly. Should now correctly identify recipes it previously
        had marked as "Pristine XXX" or "Pristine Forged XXX".

v8.40 - Craft Lite!
        - You can now use the Craft Lite button in the titlebar to switch between the Craft Full
          version and the Craft Lite version.
        - When Craft is in Lite mode, it will pick up and button mash for any recipe you start
          manually. Craft will start mashing buttons after the first "tick". This should work
          for ANY recipe, though I'm not sure I'd trust it with the level 100 artisan epic quest
          recipes.
        - Craft Lite will use the "Rare" thresholds from the Options page to determine when to
          use power and durability buffs.

v8.33 - Fixed auto-transmute functionality (I think)
      - Trimmed out much unused code.
      - Tuned buff spamming - This should speed up the crafting process immensely.
      - Added tooltips to the Durability Threshold elements explaining what they are used for.
      - Tweaked imbue code. Blessed items should now be filtered by the imbue checkbox, and imbues
        of all levels should work correctly.

v8.32 - Forcing script to forget what device it was at after finishing a craft session. This should
        eliminate a few annoying issues where you move around after doing some crafting, and the
        script thinks you're still in front of a device (or targetting a particular NPC).
      - Fixed the GUI to allow mouse focus where mouse focus is desired, e.g. the harvest list
        scrollbar. This fix also includes miscellaneous other shuffling and resizing of UI elements.

v8.31 - New option on Options tab - Save recipe list range. Enabling this option will keep EQ2Craft
        from automatically assigning the most recent 10 levels to the Recipe List drop-down box.
        The current level range will be saved when setting this option, and every time you refresh
        the list.
        *NOTE* If you set this to a large range, it may take significantly longer for Craft to
               initialize.
      - Fixed the disappearing secondary tradeskill filter. If there are any secondary tradeskill
        recipes in the level range, the secondary tradeskill filter checkbox will become visible
        when the list is refreshed.

***** THIS IS FOR THE BETA TEST OF CRAFT 8.0 -- READ THE FORUMS *****
BETA 8.0 - Fixed a ton of stuff.  A lot of things that were broken are now fixed.  I don't remember
           them all to paste them here; however, I suggest you try everything again that you had
           problems with previously.
         - Added an uption under the "Special" tab called 'Stop crafting when secondary tradeskill achieves maximum level'.
           If checked, you will stop crafting when your tinkering or transmuting skill reaches the
           maximum for your current skill level.   This value, intentionally, does not save to your configuration file.
         - Most of the textentry boxes in the UI will now update the script and save to the xml file immediately.
         - The "Custom Writs" xml file will now sort alphabetically automatically.  Simply add recipes to the bottom of
           the file as you always did, and then the next time you end craft it will sort properly upon exit.

================================================

v7.10 - EQ2Craft should be less likely to be stuck "Processing Recipes".
      - When you gain a tradeskill level (after level 20) EQ2Craft will scribe any 'essentials'
        or 'advanced' recipe books that you have in your inventory for the level gained before
        acquiring the next writ.
      - Movement issues have been addressed somewhat.  In the near future we will be transitioning
        to LavishNav, so if there are bugs remaining, they will probably remain until that transition
        is complete.

v7.09 - Added option to GUI for fine-tuning the path precision on a per-character basis. This
        option can be found on the Options tab. If you are bouncing back and forth while running
        the path, you will want to increase this number. If you are not bouncing, but are not
        getting close enough to your work tables, you will want to decrease this number.

v7.08 - Tweaks to pathing code -- should now open doors in qeynos properly again and not get
        stuck as often.
      - New path files for Qeynos and Freeport instances is on the SVN! Also updated Kelethin.

v7.07 - Minor change to inventory search -- allows for resources etc with space to underscore
        conversion; e.g. flying fish -> flying_fish_
        Note: This is an all-or-nothing conversion, either all spaces are underscores, or none.

v7.06 - Moved all writ quantities to a new file, WritCounts.xml.
      - Removed another section of code that could cause a writ to finish early.
      - Committed a Custom Writ file to the SVN. -- You may wish to back up your own
        customwrits.xml file before updating! This file has a broader assortment of recipes.

v7.05 - Changed output to default ALL output to the console. You may use /craft -verbose
        for the old behavior of output in the EQ2 chat window.
      - Fixed imbue material counting.
      - Removed code that checks for a completed writ step. It was buggy and broken anyway.
        This should fix those writs that were completing early.
      - Fixed writ quantities for level 24 armorer.

v7.04 - Fixed lvl 50 Alchemist writ quantities.
      - Fixed reset issue after finishing the requested number of writs. Craft should now
        create the correct number of writs again after running through a writ cycle.
      - Crash when turning in a writ has been fixed by Amadeus (no credit for me on this.)

v7.03 - Valerian takes over as primary maintainer of craft.
      - Fixed double hailing of writ giver.
      - Bot should now automatically create exactly enough items to complete the writ,
        whether work order or rush order. Quantity textbox in the UI now does nothing.
        *TODO* Fix quantity textbox to "add" extra quantity, for those that want a
               safety net when doing writs.
      - Support files updates:
        * Added path for Kelethin's crafting area! You should be within the building before
          starting anything requiring pathing.
        * Fixed bug where any recipe containing the word "fir" was mistakenly marked as rare.

v7.02 - Craft should no longer double click the table when going through doors in Qeynos.
      - Fixed random typos.
      - Added more resources.

v7.01 - Fixed a typo when processing writs.
      - Took out debug spam.

v7.0  - IMPORTANT On the options tab, you MUST reset and save thresholds.
         *Craft files have been updated to work with T8 (some things may still be
         missing).
         * Buff selection - Craft will spam progress buffs every round until
         QualityTier4 is under 40% (Standard Quality 1 Threshold). Then it will
         use the Highest power durability with the 2 lowest power progress buffs.
             - If QuailtyTier4 is under 20% (Standard Quality 2 Threshold), it will use
             all durability buffs.
             - If power drops below 70% (Standard Power 3 Threshold), it will stop
             using the highest power progress buff unless it is needed for a counter.
         *Counter Selection - Craft will always counter with progress buff as a
         successful counter is always a successful round. You can NOT get a
         failure or critical failure with a success full counter. If quailtytier4
         is under 20% (Standard Quality 2 Threshold) it will counter with
         durability, as even a success can lower durability slightly.
         *Tinkering and Transmuting has been updated to work like other craft
         recipes.
         *Writs have been updated to work with T8.
         *Fixed a bug when loading recipes lists via command line.

v6.9  - There is now a custom writ file in Recipe Data folder called CustomWrits.xml
        You can now set a recipe name that is extracted and set the value to what it should be. See the file for some examples.
        So if there are any wierd names for writs, just use the customwrit file for the translation.

v6.8  - Fixes.

v6.7  - Fixes.

v6.6  - Writs should now work as intended for all classes without crashes.

v6.5  - Fixed all Imbue Recipes.
      - Minor fix to Writs with regards to the quest update trigger.

v6.4  - Few minor bug fixes

v6.3  - Fixed doors in Qeynos Tradeskills

v6.2  - You can now craft a Recipe from your 'Recipe Favourites' on the command line, which will avoid any prompting.
        Example: If you had previously saved a recipe called 'Cobalt full suit' under Advanced, then based on what settings you have currently set,
        you can just type in /craft "Cobalt full suit" and it will automatically craft whatever recipes you had listed under that favourite.
      - Added an optional delay between combines. This can be found under options.
      - You can now set a durability threshold for each quality level using standard or rare recipes. This can also be found under options
        Example: If you set the Durability threshold for Quality 1 to 105%, and Quality 2, to 95%, then the craft bot will only use Durability buffs,
        if the current Durability is less than 105% during the 1st Quality and less than 95% during the 2nd and so on.
        This should allow a lot more flexibility in the crafting process.
      - Added Automatic Crafting of Writs. See the Special Tab.
        You need to select a Tier. This reflects the response you select when obtaining the writ.
        You will need to specify the quantity however, as I did not have time to figure this out. Currently this is set to 10 for each recipe.
        It wont matter if you set a higher quantity as the craft bot will end when its made enough quantity for the recipe writ.
        You can also specify how many writs you want to do.
      - Fixed a few minor bugs that have been posted on the forums.

v6.1  - If a recipe fails to load, it will now open the examine window to retrieve the data from the server.
      - Added filters (Standard, Rare, Imbued and/or Secondary TS) to display in the Recipe List.
        Note: This will also reflect what recipes are loaded as well, when you Add Level Recipes.
      - Fixed several bugs that have been posted on the forums.

v6.0  - The recipe files are no more! The recipe data is now retrieved from the server.
        Note: If the data is not available on your client, it will re-sync and re-process the recipe again.
      - You can now craft Tinkering and Transmuting recipes.
      - Select 'Automatically Transmute Master Crafted Items after Creation' in the Special tab to do just that.
        Note: This is turned off by default everytime you start craft for obvious reasons.
      - Added a checkbox to show only the Secondary Tradeskill Recipes (Tinkering or Transmuting).
      - You can now choose to wait for your power to regenerate a certain amount after each recipe is made if you wish (see options).
      - Fixed the way counters work. After each round, the buffs will be cleared before it uses them again to avoid stacking issues.
      - Tuned buffs in general so its more efficient in crafting.
      - The craft session will remain opened if you dont choose to exit after a crafting session is complete.
      - Lots of general fixes that have been posted on the forums.

v5.3  - More fixes.
      - Added option to camp out after craft session while the bot is crafting.
      - Option to pause the bot when it cant buy all harvest components.

v5.2  - Minor fixes

v5.1  - PC Detection and smarter positioning (more random and not close to other PC's) for any device or NPC.
      - Bot will just move to a station directly if not in a tradeskill instance (so no need for a path file if your crafting at home).

v5.0  - Added buying of harvests, fuels and common components Automatically.
      - Added Automatic creation of Writs.
      - Fixed an issue with missing resouces and bot locking out components in the inventory.
      - Path restructure. All files are now located under ./Scripts/EQ2Craft/...
      - Optimized code to work even faster since subcombines have been removed.
      - Bot will detect if door is open or not, and no longer stop at door to open it, but instead open it while its moving towards it (qeynos).

v4.4  - Fixed issue with not being able to craft Rare combines.
      - Rares or any other unique component used for crafting can be included in the CraftCommon.xml file.
      - Example: <Setting Name="cobalt cluster">cobalt</Setting>
        The 'cobalt cluster' is used to determine whethere is a rare or unique component.
        The 'cobalt' is used for partial matching for loading all recipes in a particular level (so any recipe that has the word cobalt will be excluded).

v4.3  - Fixed craft to work with the current stable IS release.
      - Fixed the locking of components so it should no longer happen.

v4.2  - Several Fixes to v4.1

v4.1  - Craft should now be able to make recipes with rare components.
      - Implemented an option to Save Recipe List when you begin crafting.
      - You can now load and save 'Favourite Recipe Lists' from the queue.
      - Several fixes with the craft bot thinking some harvests were recipes.

v4.0  - Conversion of code to use Objects.
      - Optmised code which will make the craft script run a lot faster.
      - It will check Primary Components and Build components for vendor bought items or harvested components regardless of process.
        This will fix any problems with Provisioner recipes in the past.
      - Fixed several bugs.

v3.4  - Few minor bug fixes.

v3.3  - Several fixes
      - Added Level Range for the recipe list.
      - Option added to skip moving to stations, and only use your current targetted station to craft. This will help for special station devices in instances.
      - Non-UI syntax: /craft "Recipe Name" <Quantity> <Quality> -p(ristine) -s(kip inventory checking) -i(gnore station check)

v3.2  - Fix for Level 1-19 Spells.

v3.0  - Fix for Kingdom of Sky Expansion and numerous changes.

v2.5  - More functionality added to the UI.

v2.0  - Special UI Edition

v1.0  - Initial Release
