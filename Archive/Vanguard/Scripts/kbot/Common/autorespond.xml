 Format of each entry is: 

<Set Name="#"> 
 <Setting Name="match">word or phrase to match on</Setting> 
 <Setting Name="delay">time in seconds before responding</Setting> 
 <Setting Name="reply">what to reply back with</Setting> 
</Set> 

 For example: 

<Set Name="10"> 
   <Setting Name="match">Hello</Setting> 
   <Setting Name="delay">3</Setting> 
   <Setting Name="reply">Hiya!</Setting> 
</Set> 

 Would respond to a tell that has "Hello" anywhere in it 
 It would wait 3 seconds before responding 
 It would respond with "Hiya!" 

 The keyword ANY will match any phrase.

--

May also use <Setting Name="action"></Setting> for action keys, such as Jump, MoveLeft, etc. 

 The following will make your toon try to open a door when told to: 

<Set Name="8"> 
   <Setting Name="match">open the door</Setting> 
   <Setting Name="delay">2</Setting> 
   <Setting Name="action">UseDoorEtc</Setting> 
</Set> 

The 'UseDoorEtc' key is defined in your Vanguard User.ini file. 

--

May also use <Setting Name="emote"></Setting> commands, but be sure to specify the / in the emote

<Set Name="6">
	<Setting Name="match">waves</Setting>
	<Setting Name="delay">2</Setting> 
	<Setting Name="emote"> /wave </Setting>
</Set>

 Order is important, as the 1st Set matched will generate the reply 
 and then will stop. So make sure you get the important ones first :)
